# Monkey Language Interpreter in Go

Welcome to the **Monkey Language Interpreter** built using Go! This README will guide you through the key features and usage of the interpreter.

## 1. Overview
This project is an implementation of the **Monkey Programming Language Interpreter**, designed from scratch using Go. It includes all the fundamental components of a language interpreter such as lexical analysis, parsing, and evaluation.

## 2. Features
- **C-like Syntax**: Supports a simple and familiar C-like syntax, making it easy to understand and use.
- **Variables & Functions**: Includes variable bindings, first-class functions, and closures.
- **Data Types**: Supports integers, booleans, strings, arrays, and hash maps.
- **Conditionals**: Implements `if-else` statements and return expressions.
- **Arithmetic & Logical Operators**: Handles basic arithmetic and logical operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, and more.
- **REPL Support**: A fully interactive Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL) to test and run code in real-time.

## 3. Dependencies
- **Go 1.23.1+**: The interpreter is built using Go and requires at least version 1.21.1.

## 4. How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the command below to start the interpreter in REPL mode:
   ```bash
   go run main.go

## 5. Example Usage
- Here's a Simple Example you can try in the REPL:
  ```bash
  let result = 10 * (2 + 3);
  result; // Output:50
